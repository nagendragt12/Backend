# Backend


# Fullstack Internship Assignment

## Objective
This project is a full-stack application that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions regarding the content of these documents. The backend processes these documents using natural language processing to provide answers to the questions posed by the users.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **NLP Processing**: LangChain/LLamaIndex
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Database**: SQLite or PostgreSQL
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem or cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3)

## Functional Requirements
### PDF Upload
- Users can upload PDF documents to the application.
- The application stores the PDF and extracts its text content for further processing.

### Asking Questions
- Users can ask questions related to the content of an uploaded PDF.
- The system processes the question and the content of the PDF to provide an answer.

### Displaying Answers
- The application displays the answer to the userâ€™s question.
- Users can ask follow-up or new questions on the same document.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Usability**: The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Performance**: The system optimizes the processing of PDF documents and the response time for answering questions.
